# OperatorMatch (OPM)

Operator Match (OPM) is a simple token lexer that parses expressions.

A huge flaw with all of my past lexers has been that i've never really had a proper token matcher.

I'd always hard-code things to be exactly how I'd write them, and that caused a lot of issues.

But now I've built OPM, which relieves the token matching pain without any REGEX.
